-  our goal in this section is to tell you about the Big-O performance for the operations on Python lists and dictionaries. We will then show you some timing experiments that illustrate the costs and benefits of using certain operations on each data structure. It is important for you to understand the efficiency of these Python data structures because they are the building blocks we will use as we implement other data structures in the remainder of the book.
